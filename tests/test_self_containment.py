"""Self-containment guard: no part of the plugin may delegate a capability to a
sibling plugin.

Rule: each plugin in the suite is fully standalone. Cross-promotion (links to the
author's other repos, marketplace install lines, shared model-registry sync
infrastructure) is fine; capability delegation is not.

Extended 2026-07-29 after the full-repo audit: the original guard scanned only
skills/agents/commands/*.md and therefore missed live violations in references/ and scripts/.
