"""The methodology's source organization must NEVER be named anywhere in the repo.

This is a hard product rule that was, until now, only ever enforced by hand —
and a violation shipped for months in a sibling plugin's spec before the
2026-07-29 audit caught it. The forbidden strings are assembled at runtime from
fragments so this test file itself keeps the repository grep-clean.

Scope narrowed at the TechShu rebrand: this repository is now owned and
maintained by Indus Net TechShu Digital Pvt. Ltd., which names itself in its
own manifests, README and author fields, so the owning company is no longer a
forbidden string here. The wider group brand remains guarded.
