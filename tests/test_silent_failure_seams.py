""""Nothing fails silently" was true of the code designed for it, and false at the seams.

A full-pipeline run with no image or video credentials found the claim holding
exactly where the plugin had thought about it — the provider chain, the price
book, the compliance gate, the asset matcher all refused honestly with named
reasons — and breaking in three places nobody had brought into the discipline:

  1. `render_preview.py` returned {"status": "success"} for an image path that
     did not exist. It wrote a real 600x800 PNG that was blank white, because
     the missing path became a file:// URI and the browser rendered a broken
     image as nothing. A reviewer approving that gallery approves a blank
     rectangle. This is the precise failure mode the plugin claims is impossible.
  2. `generate_image.py` exited 0 after every provider failed. Any `&&` chain,
     CI step, or batch loop read total failure as success — while price_book.py
     exits 3 and compliance_check.py exits 1 in the same situation, so the
     contract was inconsistent inside one plugin.
  3. `provider_failures.py` built an excellent structured record and never wrote
     it anywhere. Once stdout scrolled past, the record was gone. A record
     nobody can read afterwards is not a record.

Plus two that only bite in the no-credentials case, which is the case under test:
`cost_tracker.py --action report` raised TypeError on an unpriced entry, and
price/model lookups read a different env var than everything else, resolving to
a different workspace than costs were written to.

Stdlib only.
