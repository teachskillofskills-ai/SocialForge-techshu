## 6. Opt-in hook reference — not shipped active

**There are no hook tests.** SocialForge ships **zero global hooks** — `hooks/hooks.json` is empty by design. The four hooks that existed before v1.5.0 (SessionStart credential banner, PreToolUse compliance check, SubagentStart brand-context injection, Stop image-approval verification) were removed because they fired on every Claude Code operation in every project.

The old configuration is archived at `hooks/hooks-reference.example.json` as an opt-in example only — nothing loads it. The only thing to verify here:

- [ ] `hooks/hooks.json` contains no active hook entries | Empty by design
- [ ] No SocialForge hook fires in an unrelated project | Zero global side effects

---

## 7. Creative Pipeline Tests (End-to-End)

### Test Data
- Brand: `test-brand` with 10 product images, 3 style reference images
- Calendar: 10 posts (2 HERO, 4 HUB, 4 HYGIENE) across LinkedIn, Instagram, X

### Pipeline Phases
- [ ] Phase 1: Calendar parse | 10 posts in calendar-data.json with correct dates/platforms
- [ ] Phase 2: Asset match | All 10 posts assigned assets and creative modes
- [ ] Phase 3: Visual production (ANCHOR_COMPOSE) | Brand photo centered, AI background generated
- [ ] Phase 3: Visual production (ENHANCE_EXTEND) | Image extended without modifying core
- [ ] Phase 3: Visual production (STYLE_REFERENCED) | New image matches brand palette
- [ ] Phase 3: Visual production (PURE_CREATIVE) | Image generated from prompt + brand colors
- [ ] Phase 4: Copy generation | Master copy written for all 10 posts
- [ ] Phase 5: Copy adaptation | Platform variants respect character limits
- [ ] Phase 6: Compliance check | No false positives on clean copy; banned phrases caught
- [ ] Phase 7: Preview generation | Mockups created for each platform target
- [ ] Phase 8: Gallery build | HTML gallery renders all 10 posts with images and copy
- [ ] Pipeline resume | Kill mid-run, restart — picks up from last completed phase

---

## 8. State Machine Tests

### Valid Transitions
- [ ] `draft` -> `asset-matched` | After match-assets runs
- [ ] `asset-matched` -> `visual-ready` | After compose-creative completes
- [ ] `visual-ready` -> `copy-ready` | After adapt-copy completes
- [ ] `copy-ready` -> `compliance-passed` | After compliance check passes
- [ ] `compliance-passed` -> `in-review` | After entering review queue
- [ ] `in-review` -> `approved` | After all required approvals received
- [ ] `in-review` -> `revision-requested` | After reviewer requests changes
- [ ] `revision-requested` -> `visual-ready` or `copy-ready` | After revision applied
- [ ] `approved` -> `finalized` | After finalize completes

### Invalid Transitions
- [ ] `draft` -> `approved` | Rejected — cannot skip production phases
- [ ] `finalized` -> `draft` | Rejected — cannot revert finalized content
- [ ] `in-review` -> `finalized` | Rejected — must be approved first
- [ ] `compliance-passed` -> `approved` | Rejected — must go through review

---

## 9. Approval Workflow Tests

### HERO Path (highest scrutiny)
- [ ] HERO post enters review with 3 required reviewers | social-lead, brand-manager, creative-director
- [ ] Partial approval (1 of 3) does not advance post | Remains in-review
- [ ] Full internal approval triggers client review | Client notification sent or staged
- [ ] Client approval triggers CEO approval | CEO review step activated
- [ ] CEO approval marks post as fully approved | Status: approved
- [ ] Escalation triggers after max_review_hours exceeded | Reminder sent or escalation logged

### HUB Path (standard)
- [ ] HUB post requires social-lead + brand-manager | 2 reviewers minimum
- [ ] Client approval required, CEO approval not | Correct approval chain
- [ ] Approved HUB post can be finalized | Moves to finalized without CEO step

### HYGIENE Path (lightweight)
- [ ] HYGIENE post requires social-lead only | 1 reviewer minimum
- [ ] No client or CEO approval required | Moves directly to approved after internal review
- [ ] Approved HYGIENE post finalizes cleanly | Delivery output includes post

## 10. MCP Connector Tests

Test each connector loads and responds. These require active OAuth/authentication.

| # | Connector | Test | Expected Result |
|---|-----------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Notion | Read a Notion page | Page content returned |
| 2 | Canva | List Canva designs | Design list returned or auth prompt |
| 3 | Slack | Send test message to channel | Message delivered |
| 4 | Gmail | Read inbox | Recent emails listed or auth prompt |
| 5 | Google Calendar | List events | Calendar events returned |
| 6 | Figma | Read a Figma file | File data returned |
| 7 | fal.ai | Generate test image | Image URL returned |
| 8 | Replicate | Run test model | Prediction result returned |
| 9 | Asana | List tasks | Task list returned |

- [ ] Plugin loads without errors when connectors are not authenticated | Graceful "not connected" handling
- [ ] Plugin loads without errors when no connectors are configured | Full offline functionality

---

## 11. Carousel Template Tests

Test each of the 8 templates renders correctly.

- [ ] `tips-5slide.html` renders 5 slides | All slides visible, brand colors applied
- [ ] `recap-6slide.html` renders 6 slides | Correct slide count, content injected
- [ ] `data-infographic-6slide.html` renders 6 slides | Data values display correctly
- [ ] `generic-8slide.html` renders 8 slides | Generic content populates all slides
- [ ] `playbook-8slide.html` renders 8 slides | Step numbering correct
- [ ] `comparison-10slide.html` renders 10 slides | Side-by-side layout preserved
- [ ] `case-study-10slide.html` renders 10 slides | Client name, metrics, quotes injected
- [ ] `quote-card-single.html` renders 1 slide | Quote text, attribution, and brand styling correct
- [ ] All templates apply brand colors from brand-config.json | Hex colors match config
- [ ] All templates apply brand fonts from brand-config.json | Font family matches config
- [ ] Logo overlay placed correctly on all templates | Logo visible and correctly positioned
- [ ] Output dimensions match platform specs (1080x1080 for LinkedIn/Instagram carousels) | Pixel dimensions verified

---

## 12. Edge Cases

### Missing Brand
- [ ] Running `/socialforge:generate-all` with no active brand | Clear error: "Brand not found" with fix instructions
- [ ] Running `/socialforge:index-assets` with nonexistent brand slug | Error with suggestion to run brand-setup

### Empty Calendar
- [ ] Running `/socialforge:generate-all` with empty calendar-data.json | Graceful message: "No posts in calendar"
- [ ] Parsing a blank DOCX | Error: "No posts found in calendar source"

### No Assets
- [ ] Running pipeline with zero indexed assets | Posts default to PURE_CREATIVE mode
- [ ] Running ANCHOR_COMPOSE with no matching asset | Fallback to STYLE_REFERENCED or PURE_CREATIVE

### API Failures
- [ ] Image generation API returns 429 (rate limit) | Retry with backoff, resume supported
- [ ] Image generation API returns 500 (server error) | Error logged, post marked as failed, pipeline continues
- [ ] All API keys missing | Clear error listing which keys are needed

### File System
- [ ] Path with spaces in brand name | Handled correctly (slug is kebab-case)
- [ ] Very long file names (>200 chars) | Truncated or handled without OS error
- [ ] Output directory does not exist | Created automatically

### Large Calendars
- [ ] Calendar with 60+ posts | Pipeline handles without timeout (may need batching)
- [ ] Calendar with posts spanning multiple months | Only target month posts processed
